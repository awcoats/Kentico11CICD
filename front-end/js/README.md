# js

1. All scripts for the front end build should be placed within either the "custom" or "vendor" directories within this folder.
2. All scripts should be included individually and will be compiled into front-end/js/frontEnd.js by Gulp
3. There should be no "all" or "common" js that has various scripts incuded in one file unless it is calls to vendor scripts or something similar and very generic.
